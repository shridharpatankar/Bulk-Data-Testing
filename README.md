# Bulk-Data-Testing
Bulk Data Testing for Salesforce

This tool provides you with a simple to use user interface to create multiple Salesforce records, update and delete them in bulk.

You can also quickly create sample data in bulk (let's say 200 records) for your development/testing.

It also provides you the salesforce governor limit details that your transaction has used up. This will be greatly useful while testing/performance tuning your bulkfied trigger code.
